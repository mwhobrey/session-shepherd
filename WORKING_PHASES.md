Phase 1: Pre-Launch Hardening (The Final Polish)
Timeline: Now â€“ End of this week (approx. Oct. 10)
Goal: To find and crush any remaining bugs and ensure v1.0 is absolutely rock-solid.

[ ] My Task: Intensive "Dogfooding." I will continue to use Session Shepherd for all my daily work, specifically targeting the new v1.1 features. I will push it to its limits.

[ ] Your Team's Task: Final Code Review & Triage. Conduct a final review of the codebase for any last-minute cleanup. Be on standby to address any critical bugs I log in YouTrack.

[ ] Shared Goal: Zero Critical Bugs. By the end of this phase, we should have a release candidate with no known critical or blocking issues.

Phase 2: Go-to-Market (The Storefront Buildout)
Timeline: In parallel with Phase 1 (This Week)
Goal: Prepare all necessary assets for a professional and compelling Chrome Web Store listing.

[ ] My Task: Finalize Logo Package. I will provide you with the finalized SVG and the required PNG sizes (128x128, 48x48, 16x16) for the extension.

[ ] My Task: Draft Store Listing Copy. I will write the primary description, a short, catchy tagline, and key feature bullet points for the store page. I'll share this for your review.

[ ] Your Team's Task: Generate High-Quality Screenshots. Capture a series of clean, compelling screenshots of the extension in action. We'll need about 5-7 images showcasing:

The "Create" Tab

The "Sessions" Tab (with a few saved sessions)

The Session Content Preview

The Dark Mode theme

The new Domain Filtering feature

[ ] Shared Task: Create a Simple Privacy Policy. We need to write a basic, plain-language privacy policy. For v1.0, it can be as simple as stating that all user data is stored locally via chrome.storage.local and is never transmitted or sold.

Phase 3: Public Launch (Version 1.0)
Timeline: Next Week (approx. Oct. 13-17)
Goal: Successfully submit and publish Session Shepherd on the Chrome Web Store.

[ ] Your Team's Task: Package the Extension. Create the final, zipped .zip package for the release candidate.

[ ] Shared Task: Set Up Developer Account. Ensure your Google account is registered and set up in the Chrome Developer Dashboard.

[ ] Your Team's Task: Create and Configure the Store Listing.

Create a new item for Session Shepherd.

Upload the extension package.

Fill in all the copy from Phase 2.

Upload the screenshots and logo/promo assets.

Configure all necessary fields (category, languages, etc.).

[ ] Shared Task: Final Review & Submission. We both give the store listing one final look-over, and then you hit the "Submit for Review" button.

[ ] Shared Task: Monitor & Celebrate. We wait for Google's review process to complete. Once it's approved and live, we celebrate a job well done.
